# DiceChallenge
- A small project using javascript.
- This project is developed with the help of DOM model in the JS.
- I have learned about DOM model briefly with the help of this project.
- Its a project from hands on session from udemy.
- I wanted to be much familiar with hosting a website in real time so I have hosted this project on github.
